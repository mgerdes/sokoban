# Sokoban

Toy project for learning about making a game in OpenGL / C (e.g. doing things like lighting, shading, texturing, matrix maths, etc...). 
Might turn it into some sort of Rosetta stone for learning about this in other languages as well.

# Dependencies

OpenGL, GLEW, and GLFW

# Running

Running `make` should compile everything. Then `./sokoban` to actually run it. I've only compiled / ran it on a 64-bit Arch Linux distribution.
